# acrobot_dp


The gymnast only applies control input at his waist. She begins from her initial position of hanging down from the bar and wants to end up at a terminal position where she is upright. Note that the vertical position is an equilibrium position, he stay there indefinitely without any control input. This project provides a dynamic programming solution to take the Acrobot from the initial condition to the terminal condition.

This also provides a solution using LQR where the assumption is that the Acrobot starts from a near equilibrium state.
